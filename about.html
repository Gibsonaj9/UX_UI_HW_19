            I come from a background of architecture where I first nurtured my creativity. 
            Then I studied graphic design where I was exposed to software like Photoshop. 
            I wanted to apply my creativity in a different field than what I’m used to, 
            that’s why I am passionate about UI/UX design.

            I recently completed a UX/UI bootcamp course at Monash university to help improve my skills and introduce me to coding. 
            I worked as an architect role in Bangkok for 10 years and now I am excited to start new role which is to become a UX/UI designer.

            I use social media a lot where I get inspiration and share photos which range from recipes to interesting events and places. 
            In my spare time I sketch designs for birthday cards, logos and artwork for friends. 
            I also create things using a craft printer which allows me to cut and make physical designs.
